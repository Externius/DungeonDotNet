# DungeonDotNet
I just wanted to see how is the .NET Core under Linux so i ported my app to ASP.NET Core + Entity Framework Core (using SQLite). There are some AngularJS code too. 

You will need the .NET SDK to build/run this project (simply run dotnet build/run in the terminal).

## Usage:

Open the http://localhost:5000 address in a browser.

You can log in with TestUser/testPassword12345

From there you can Generate/Save/Load dungeons, just like in the Android app.
